`dawn` helps you modernize your build without leaving your existing ecosystems behind.
The IDE integrations, refactoring tools, etc. that you depend on will continue to work,
with many of the benefits of a modern build system:

- Content-based checks for out-of-date targets
- Parallel builds by default
- Build files written in Starlark, a dialect of Python
- Watch mode to automatically rebuild when files change
- Performance profiling for builds
- Cross-platform tooling
- ...and more
